# BBC-Micro-1770-Floppy-Controller

This is a 1770 standard floppy controller for the BBC Micro.  If you ended up with an OPUS
or other type of controller and want to go back to vanilla BBC 1770 or just build a 
BBC 1770 controller this is for you.

Fitting instructions as per Acorn_1770DiskIFUpgrade.pdf
